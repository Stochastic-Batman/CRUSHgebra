    "- For binary categorical variables, binary encoding doesn't create artificial ordinal relationships. Each variable will simply map to 0 or 1.\n",
    "- For nominal variables (`Mjob`, `Fjob`, `reason`, `guardian`), one-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, preventing the model from assuming false ordinal relationships (e.g., \"teacher\" > \"health\"). This is not an overhead, as none of these variables take more than four possible values.\n",
    "- Ordinal categorical variables are numerical features for this dataset. We standardize all numerical columns. This is necessary because even though ordinal variables have meaningful ordering, they exist on different scales (some 0-4, others 1-5, and `absences` goes 0-93), which would cause the neural network to give disproportionate weight to larger-scale features during gradient descent. Standardization puts all features on the same scale ($\\mu=0, \\sigma=1$) so the network can learn their relative importance based on predictive power, not magnitude."

The parameter count of $\\approx 1,500$ aligns better with the dataset size compared to deeper alternatives. Each head uses a single hidden layer of `HEAD_SIZE` neurons before outputting predictions. A single dropout layer after the first shared layer provides regularization at the point of highest dimensionality where overfitting risk is greatest, while the second layer's batch normalization alone sufficiently regularizes the smaller `HEAD_SIZE`-dimensional representation that feeds into both specialized heads.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation of three multi-task models with different alpha values - the parameter that balances the weight between the grade regression (`G3`) and romance classification tasks - a clear performance hierarchy is established, with $\\alpha=0.5$ emerging as the optimal configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with $\\alpha=0.3$ places less emphasis on the grade prediction task. This results in the highest test MAE of $2.066$ for grades and a higher total test loss compared to $\\alpha=0.5$, suggesting its weighting is suboptimal for the primary objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with $\\alpha=0.5$ demonstrates the best balance. It achieves the lowest Grade Prediction MAE of $1.931$ on the test set, indicating the most accurate forecasts. Its total test loss of $3.735$ is the lowest among all models, and it exhibits a healthy generalization pattern where validation and test losses are lower than training loss. This indicates that the auxiliary romance task, while not producing meaningful classifications itself, provides a beneficial regularization effect at this weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the model with $\\alpha=0.7$ heavily prioritizes the grade task. However, this leads to overfitting, evidenced by its significantly higher total test loss of $5.099$. While its grade MAE of $1.943$ is better than $\\alpha=0.3$, it is still worse than $\\alpha=0.5$. The romantic loss also shows a larger gap between training and test performance, further confirming overfitting. This implies that completely overshadowing the auxiliary task removes its regularizing benefit, degrading overall model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the romance classifier failed universally, its influence as a regularizer is crucial. The balanced weighting at $\\alpha=0.5$ provides the ideal compromise, yielding the most accurate and generalizable model for the primary task of grade prediction, making it the definitive best choice."
