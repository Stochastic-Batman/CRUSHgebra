    "- Ordinal categorical variables are numerical features for this dataset. We standardize all numerical columns. This is necessary because even though ordinal variables have meaningful ordering, they exist on different scales (some 0-4, others 1-5, and `absences` goes 0-93), which would cause the neural network to give disproportionate weight to larger-scale features during gradient descent. Standardization puts all features on the same scale ($\\mu=0, \\sigma=1$) so the network can learn their relative importance based on predictive power, not magnitude."

The parameter count of $\\approx 1,500$ aligns better with the dataset size compared to deeper alternatives. Each head uses a single hidden layer of `HEAD_SIZE` neurons before outputting predictions. A single dropout layer after the first shared layer provides regularization at the point of highest dimensionality where overfitting risk is greatest, while the second layer's batch normalization alone sufficiently regularizes the smaller `HEAD_SIZE`-dimensional representation that feeds into both specialized heads. Dropout rate of $0.2$ is a classic."
